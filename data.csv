AP Computer Science Teacher
Background on Brooke
Brooke Charter Schools opened Brooke High in August of 2016, and we are looking for exceptional educators to add to our founding team, who can help build a strong school culture focused on rigorous academics and developing strength of character.
Founded in 2002, Brooke Charter Schools is a network of college preparatory public schools with five campuses in Boston. Brooke currently serves 1,730 students in grades K-10 and will grow to serve 2,200 students in grades K-12 by 2022.  
Named after the late Senator Edward W. Brooke, the first African-American popularly elected to the U.S. Senate, our strategy is to focus relentlessly on developing excellent teaching.  Reflecting the diversity of the communities we serve in Boston and Chelsea, 56% of Brooke students self-identify as Black, 34% as Latino, 6% Caucasian, 2% Asian, and 2% Native American or multiracial. About three-quarters of Brooke students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Over the last several years, Brooke students have set a new bar for what is possible in urban public education, consistently outperforming their peers in Boston Public Schools, and producing academic achievement results among the highest in the state.
Across Brooke, computer science is a central feature of the curriculum. In grades 1-8, Brooke students study coding and robotics 60 minutes per week, using a range of introductory languages and platforms, including Code.org, Pencil Code, Scratch, LEGO Mindstorms, and App Inventor. The high school computer science program will build on this foundation, with three years of compulsory computer science and a fourth elective year. Our goal is to prepare every student at Brooke High to take the Advanced Placement (AP) CSA exam.
Role & Responsibilities
This is an exciting opportunity to join a growing CS department at a school deeply committed to CS education. The AP Computer Science teacher will be responsible for preparing all 11th grade Brooke High scholars (some 70 students in 2018-2019) for the AP exams, with most taking AP CS A. Every student in the course will have already taken a full-year Java development course in grade 9, and a full-year Arduino development class in grade 10.
Every Brooke High teacher is also responsible for serving as an advisor. Advisors serve as student mentors, parent communication liaisons, and college counselors for a small single gender group of students. Advisories meet twice daily; each day begins with a short check-in and ends with a 25-minute advisory session. Additionally, advisories engage in weekly classes designed around college information and character education.
Teachers’ hours are 7:45-4:00 daily, with the student academic day running from 8:00-2:05 on Mondays and 8:00-3:45 on other days. Teachers may elect to lead an after-school extra-curricular club or coach a sport for an additional stipend. In 2018, teacher PD will begin on July 16th, and the school year will begin in late August.
A successful Brooke High School AP Computer Science Teacher will ensure that all Brooke scholars feel challenged and known.
Requirements
Bachelor’s degree
Deep content knowledge of computer science
Minimum of two (2) years of teaching experience as a classroom teacher (excluding student teaching, practicum, or international teaching experience)
Exceptional interpersonal skills with students, parents, and colleagues
Commitment to ensuring academic success for all students
Shared dedication to Brooke’s mission and organizational values
Excellent teamwork, communication, initiative, urgency, and positivity
The community and students we serve are diverse, and we are committed to reflecting that diversity in our staff. We strive to have the most diverse applicant pool possible; to that end, we encourage individuals of all backgrounds to apply for any position at Brooke Charter Schools. By fostering a diverse and inclusive environment, we provide the best educational experience to prepare our students for a future reflective of the world we live in.

21,Columbus School for Girls,"Job description
We are searching for a Unicorn.
  Right now, the computer science industry is creating jobs at three times the national average of other industries. Earning potential is high and the gender wage gap is low. However, if trends continue, researchers estimate that women will hold only 20% of computer science jobs in 2025.
  You can change this.
  We are looking for someone who loves computer science and believes that coding IS for girls. We are looking for a professional with experience in the industry or for someone who is just “wicked smart” with technology. We know you may be able to make more money in the field (the research shows that on average you may make up to $100,000 a year) but that your heart may not be fulfilled. Our students will help you fill that void. You will teach the basics or even BASIC, but also inspire our students to envision their own futures in computer science.
  We admit, we are looking for a Unicorn. But, one thing we know at CSG is that Unicorns do exist.

AMENDED
Position Summary: The New York City school system is the largest in the country, composed of approximately 75,000+ teachers in 1,800+ schools.
The Office of Postsecondary Readiness (OPSR) focuses on the alignment of school curriculum, instruction, and operations to ensure that all students graduate college and career ready. OPSR provides leadership and implementation support for the DOE’s college and career articulation initiatives and Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs. As part of the Division of Teaching and Learning (DT&L), OPSR develops and implements strategy and policy for increasing capacity across DOE schools in ways that will significantly increase the number of students who graduate college and career ready and persist through their postsecondary choices. As part of this work, the NYCDOE has led the creation of several programs and pilots to expand computer science education, particularly for students traditionally underrepresented in the technology sector (Black and Latino, and female students).
The City is committed to expanding access to educational opportunities in computer science and related disciplines. Computer Science for All (CS4All) is a component of the Chancellor and Mayor’s Equity and Excellence plan for driving educational achievement citywide. Through an unprecedented public-private partnership, by 2025, all NYC public school students will receive meaningful, high‐quality Computer Science (CS) education at each school level: elementary, middle, and high school. Over the next 10 years, the DOE will train nearly 5,000 teachers who will bring CS education to the City’s ~1.1 million public school students. The project is expected to develop, strengthen and document practices that can be scaled up to a broader array of schools toward the goal of significantly increasing the number of NYC students studying computer science and graduating college and career ready.
A team of Computer Science Education Managers, under the supervision of the Senior Director, Implementation for Computer Science Education, will serve as integrated members of the Field Support Centers (FSCs). Each manager is responsible for leading the implementation of borough-specific computer science programs, pilots, and initiatives, with the overarching objective of ensuring equitable access to high-quality computer science education for all students, particularly those who are underrepresented in technology-related career fields and higher education programs. Successful managers will quickly develop capacity in schools, and successfully cultivate and manage relationships with partner institutions, businesses, educators, and NYC’s diverse network of CS education nonprofit organizations. Each manager will collaborate with other members of the OPSR Team, other DT&L teams, school principals and staff, employer partners, CUNY and other higher education partners. Performs related work.
